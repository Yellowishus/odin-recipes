    <h2>This iced peach tea lemonade is similar to the familiar Arnold Palmer, which is a blend of tea and lemonade. This peach-infused version is based on a drink I tried at a local brewery.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 1/2 cups water, divded</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 peach-flavored tea bags</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together 1 1/2 cups water, sugar, and sliced peaches in a large pot. Bring to a simmer, and simmer until sugar is dissolved, the mixture is syrupy, and syrup is infused with peach flavor, about 10 minutes. Set syrup aside to cool, then strain off peaches; reserve peaches for another use. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in another pot bring remaining 4 cups water to a boil. Turn heat off. Add tea bags; steep 4 to 6 minutes. Remove tea bags and discard. </li>
        <li>Add lemon juice to syrup. To each glass add ice and 6 ounces brewed tea. Sweeten each glass to taste with 1 to 2 ounces lemon-peach syrup. </li>
    </ol>
